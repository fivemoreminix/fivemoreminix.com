A digital chirp fills my quiet bedroom with a volley of sound, jarring me awake.

“Unit 148, I have traffic.”

I jump out of bed, onto my feet, and start feeling for the light switch. The lights come on, and I grab the Bee. “This is 148, go ahead.”

“Be enroute to 1502 W Oak St. There’s a 48 year old female vomiting blood and unable to ambulate.”

I slide my feet into my boots and zip up the sides. I grab the keys, my wallet, and my phone which reads 3:08 am. “Copy.”

Now that I have everything I need together, I have to go grab my partner. Williams sleeps on the furthest side of the station. It’s only the two of us, for 48 or 72 hours at a time, yet we have 4 bedrooms. Three are tiny, one is medium sized. It used to be an office. He sleeps in the big bedroom. He’s the paramedic after all, he probably deserves the better room.

I sleep in the nicest small bedroom. It’s a 6 foot by 5 foot room, with a twin bed and a TV that doesn’t get any channels. I call it the nicest because it’s the only room that doesn’t have a hole in the wall or the ceiling. We had a fourth bedroom but it’s full of carseats. A paramedic I worked with is a children’s car-seat inspector. Whatever that means. She had about 8 of them in there. When she moved stations, they stayed.

I get to Williams’ door and knock gently, and let him know we have a call. I hear him putting on his clothes and his boots. I always slept in my clothes. I was afraid to wake up and need to throw them all on, after all I had to also pick up the phone, take the report, and let my partner know. I didn’t want to waste time.

I head out to the garage that we considered our commons room. It had a white folding table in the back behind our two ambulances, four seats, an ash tray, some cigarettes, and any paperwork from the day. It was where we watched TikToks and waited for the calls to come through.

I’m now starting the truck, filling the room with fumes as I open the garage door with the button on the visor. In the right mirror I see my partner retrieve a cigarette from the table and light it. Over the IP radio, I begin a transmission.

“148 enroute.”

“Copy, 148. Enroute 0314.”

We climb into the ambulance and I give my report to Williams.

“It’s a middle aged woman vomiting blood.”

“Alright. What’s our ETA?”

I’m opening Google Maps. “…looks like 30 minutes.”

I pull out of the garage in our large box style ambulance, hitting the button on the visor after I’m clear of the door. I get out onto the main road, away from homes, before I hit the lights. There’s no point in running the sirens. There’s hardly a soul on the road this late at night. It’s a town of only 3,000 people.

30 minutes is more like 20 when you’re going 15 over the speed limit. When there were cars out on the highway, I’d turn on my siren. But when they were far away, I’d turn it off. No point in hearing that thing. I was driving down the same roads I’ve been down yesterday, the week before, and every week before that. I knew every bump in the road and where to turn.

Williams was always in one of three states: napping, watching TikTok, or smoking a Marlboro Red. He’s 35 and fit, with curly grey hair, a brown beard, and colored tattoos covering his arms. A marine turned paramedic. Good under stress.

As our ambulance bounces and apexes the corners, Williams is enjoying his cigarette and watching the road. I don’t smoke, but I came to enjoy the smell of his cigarettes. They felt like a reminder of the kind of gritty work we do. A reminder like that at the age of 20, I am a man.

At the 5 minutes ETA, Williams starts on his paperwork. He gets his gloves on, and hands me a pair. I’m putting them on as I’m steadying the ambulance on a narrow highway road.

We pull up to the driveway, and I back in. They hear, “beep, beep, beep, beep, beep…”

We unload the powercot and start to get inside. The husband meets us at the door, his concern visible through his facial expressions. We’re stoic, asking where she is. He walks us to the bedroom, and there’s vomit visible on the floor, with a little blood in it. The patient is in the tripod position, leaning off the edge of the bed. Williams gets to her and starts collecting a chief complaint, does a size up, and asks if she can walk. She says she’s experience severe nausea, but she can walk with assistance to the cot.

I’ve unbuckled all of the seatbelts on the cot and raised the back to near vertical so she can sit down. We assist her with moving, and help raise her legs up onto the cot. We buckle her in and start the task of finding out which hospital she wants to go to.

“Which hospital do you want to go to, sweetie?”, Williams says.

“Can I go to the Briar Hospital?”

“Well, you might not want to go there. We could get you there, they hold you for an hour, and then ship you out to Northeast Medical Center, so you’d end up wasting a few hours. They’re not really much more than a bandaid station.”

“Okay. Then we can go to Northeast.”

“Alright, sweetie, I think you would prefer it.”
The company gets to bill by the mile, so we think it’s in the company’s and the patient’s interest to transport to the bigger, better hospital further away. That’s what we’re thinking without even saying it. But we don’t get a commission. We’re getting paid the same regardless of the trip.

The husband acknowledges the decision, and we get the patient out to our ambulance. Two clasps at the back of the cot hook onto the rail mounted to the floor of the ambulance. The minus button causes the wheels to retract up into the cot, and then I slide the cot into the ambulance, using its momentum to pull myself up into the truck and slow the patient down at the same time.

I get behind the patient in the captain’s seat, and start collecting her basic information; like her name, social security number, date of birth, age, and insurance policy and member ID. I write this information onto the report my partner had started while we were driving here.

He gets a set of vitals, I write them down, and then I help him start an IV. He’s working on getting a line, and asks me for an 18 gauge catheter. He asks for Zofran. I open the sliding cabinet, pull out the medications box, and look for the label “Zofran”. The tincture reads “Ondansetron” and the expiration date is several months away. I hand him the bottle and put the medications back in the cabinet.

I ask, “You ready?”

Pushing saline he says, “Yep, let’s go.”

The trip is an hour and 10 minutes of the same, long highway road that winds every 15 miles. We’re met with a handful of cars on our way to the city. Our lights and sirens are off but the truck is hurrying to its destination, still speeding 10 or 15 miles per hour over the posted speed limit.

Driving down the same long highway reminded me of the time I fell asleep at the wheel, transporting a patient to the hospital. The rumble strip separating us from oncoming traffic woke me up. Our days could be so long, that we run all day, go to bed at midnight, and still get called out 15 minutes later. On the other hand, some days we might not run any calls at all.

We get into the ER at Northwest and they give us a room immediately. We move the patient to the bed using the bedsheet from our cot. Williams starts giving report to the pretty nurse. I take the cot out into the hallway and start cleaning it using sanitizing wipes. They say the cleaning agent crosses the blood-brain barrier, so you should wear gloves if you don’t want to get cancer. When I’m done I take the cot out to the truck and change the sheet, getting it ready for another patient.

Almost right as I’m done, Williams comes out holding the clipboard in his left hand. We climb into the truck, and he lights another cigarette as we pull out of the parking lot. He tells me about the nurse and starts to find her on Facebook. Two weeks later she’s sharing his room at the station.

It’s another long drive back across the same highway while Williams smokes his cigarettes over my Five Finger Death Punch song “Wrong Side of Heaven.” We stop to get gas 30 minutes away from the station, in the middle of nowhere, Pine Valley. As soon as we’re back, we relax at the commons table for a moment before we say our tired goodbyes and go off to sleep.

We get just two hours sleep before another call at 7:30.

The loud chirp jars me awake, followed by words that I’m still deciphering as I hear them.

“-male, multiple GSW. A nurse is on scene with the patient and has stopped bleeding.”

Now I’m very awake.

“Can you repeat the address?”
“Sure. Address is 158 Hwy 56, Pine Valley.”

I’m now typing this address into my phone, trying to get it to populate the correct address.

“10–4, show us enroute.”

“Copy. Enroute 0734.”

I grab up my wallet, my phone, and my knife. I stumble from my bed to the door, swinging it open, holding my boots in the left hand. I go to my partner’s door and knock loudly, telling him it’s a multiple GSW in Pine Valley. There’s no sound but hurried putting on of clothes.

I stop there at the door and begin putting on my shoes, the shakes beginning to start. But the trust in Williams makes me comforted, at least. Even though the adrenaline is beginning to hit. He’s much smarter and better at his job than the other people I worked with. I know it will be alright, but Pine Valley is 30 minutes away.

I head out to the garage, start the truck, get the garage door opened, and make sure I have everything. Williams is already getting into the truck with his belongings and untucked shirt. He lights his cigarette on the way, starting his report as soon as we leave the garage. I’m starting the lights and accelerating out of the parking lot into morning traffic.

As soon as I make it to the intersection, I start the wailing siren, jump out onto the road, and make it halfway across town in 2 minutes. I’m driving around cars at the intersection, my blue and red lights reflecting off of their vehicles as I pass by.

Williams makes the decision to call dispatch to request a helicopter due to the distance from any major hospital. Dispatch starts working on it.

I drove as fast I could, safely, and we made it there in 17 minutes. We pull up to the scene to find a crowd in the driveway of a house immediately off the highway we drive to the hospital. I pull straight into the driveway, not wasting any time. Williams and I both see the patient in a puddle of blood, unmoving. The nurse sister runs up to the passenger window and explains that she has tried her best to stop his bleeding before we got there.

We roll the cot right up next to the patient, pick him up and put him on it, and load him into our ambulance. Here we shut the doors, and strip him trauma naked. The bleeds are now very obvious. The patient is lying flat on their back, eyes wide open, pale, and clearly in shock. I’m seated to the right of the patient, Williams to the left.

The patient bleeds steadily from a hole in their right upper arm, a hole in their right shoulder, a hole in the left upper chest, and a hole in the neck. Williams starts working on the chest wound, and I get a CAT tourniquet out and apply it to the patient’s right arm, and secure it as high as I can, just above the bullet hole. I’m reassuring the victim, telling him he will be alright as I turn the windlass, feeling the resistance as I remember my instructor saying, “720 degrees.” When it’s very tight and there’s no longer any bleeding, I lock the windlass but I forget to write a time.

Now I need to worry about the other holes. We roll him to his left to see whether there are exit wounds. We roll him back and I use gauze to stop the neck bleed. My partner has already stopped the other bleeds and checks the patient’s lungs with the stethoscope but finds nothing. He begins to call report to Traumacom. The helicopter is just about to arrive in the middle of the highway, blocking traffic.

Williams and I look at each other, with serious expressions. We spoke to each other, without a word. It was time to make sure we dot our i’s, and cross our t’s. The helicopter is going to be here in a minute and we need a line, morphine, vitals, all ABCs secure, and a patient ready to transport.

We get a line, morphine and saline going, and then the flight crew opens the doors to our ambulance. They step inside and get started running a 12-lead EKG and we move the patient to the flight crew’s specialized cot.

The helicopter drowns out all the other sounds as we approach from the front. We’re pushing the cot up the road. I’m crouched down to the height of the patient, while the flight crew knows exactly how high they can stand. I’m afraid of getting my head removed. I hear “whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop…” directly over my head.

We need to slide the patient to the helicopter using a spine board. I get on the right side of the board, my partner on the left, flight nurse to the front, and the flight medic to the back right. I noticed the imbalance and I mentioned it to the medic, but he shrugged it off. We pick the patient up, and he banks to the left, there’s a struggle, and I reach all the way over the patient and grab the left side of the board, and pull it up. We get the patient into the helicopter.

I watch the helicopter take off with our patient, permitting the normal resume of traffic. We talk to bystanders on scene for a while, and dump a bag of saline flush onto the puddle of blood to clean it off their driveway.

We get back into the ambulance and sigh. My partner lights a cigarette and we agree on Burger King and an energy drink from the Shell.

“148, Dispatch. Show us clear.”

“Copy, 148. Clear 0833.”

Hour 32 of our 72 hour shift.

We heard a week later that he lived.
