# $ cat fivemoreminix.txt

I'm Luke Wilson, known as fivemoreminix online. Programming has been my hobby for the last nine years. Ever since, I've been fascinated by data structures, compilers, and software optimization. I have been through several life changes, going from high school student, to Asphalt worker, to [Emergency Medical Technican](/img/nremt.png), and now entrepreneur, but programming has always stayed with me.

My username is a reference to the Minix operating system designed by Andrew Tanenbaum for teaching operating system development, which inspired the Linux operating system and many others.
