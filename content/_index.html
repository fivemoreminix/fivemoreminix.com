<p>I'm Luke Wilson, known as fivemoreminix online. Programming has been my hobby for the last nine years. Ever since, I've been fascinated by data structures, compilers, and software optimization. I have been through several life changes, going from high school student, to Asphalt worker, to <a href="/img/nremt.png">Emergency Medical Technican</a>, and now entrepreneur, but programming has always stayed with me.</p>
<p>My username is a reference to the Minix operating system designed by Andrew Tanenbaum for teaching operating system development, which inspired the Linux operating system and many others.</p>
